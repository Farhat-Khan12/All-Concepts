1. MongoDB is developed in C++.
2. Works on the concept of collection and Document.
3. MongoDB is a cross-platform, document oriented database that provides, high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.
4. Advantages of MongoDB
-Schema Less
    MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
    Structure of a single object is clear.
    No complex joins.
    Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL.
    Tuning.
-Ease of scale-out
     MongoDB is easy to scale.
    Conversion/mapping of application objects to database objects not needed.
    Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.

5. MongoDB provides two types of data models: â€” 
-Embedded data model
    In this model, you can have (embed) all the related data in a single document, it is also known as de-normalized data model.
    {
	_id: ,
	Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
	Personal_details:{
		First_Name: "Radhika",
		Last_Name: "Sharma",
		Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
	},
	Contact: {
		e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
		phone: "9848022338"
	},
	Address: {
		city: "Hyderabad",
		Area: "Madapur",
		State: "Telangana"
	}
}

-Normalized data model
    In this model, you can refer the sub documents in the original document, using references. For example, you can re-write the above document in the normalized model as:
    Employee:
    {
	    _id: <ObjectId101>,
	    Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
    }
    Personal_details:
    {
	    _id: <ObjectId102>,
	    empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	    First_Name: "Radhika",
	    Last_Name: "Sharma",
        Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
    }
    Contact:
    {
        _id: <ObjectId103>,
	    empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	    e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
	    phone: "9848022338"
    }
    Address:
    {
	    _id: <ObjectId104>,
	    empDocID: " ObjectId101",
	    city: "Hyderabad",
	    Area: "Madapur",
	    State: "Telangana"
    }
