Express.js, or simply Express, is a free, open-source, lightweight, and fast backend web application framework for Node.js. 
It is released as open-source software under the MIT License.

Features
- js can be used to design single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications and APIs.
- It allows to set up middleware to respond to HTTP/RESTful Requests.
- It defines a routing table to perform different HTTP operations (method and URL).
- It allows to dynamically rendering HTML Pages based on passing arguments to templates.
- It provides high performance because of its ultra-fast I/O. It prepares a thin layer; therefore, the performance is adequate.
- Its MVC-like structure makes it organize the web application into MVC architecture.
- It provides good database support. It supports RDBMS as well as NoSQL databases.
- It is asynchronous and single-threaded.
- Its robust API makes routing easy.

Express.js is an automatically prebuilt Node.js framework that facilitates us to create server-side web applications faster and smarter. 
The main reason for choosing Express is its simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, and scalability characteristics.
